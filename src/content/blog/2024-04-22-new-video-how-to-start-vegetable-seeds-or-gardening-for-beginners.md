**Starting your vegetable garden from seeds** is possible, and it is way cheaper than buying ready-to-sow plants that cost 10 times more.

You need just a few seed propagators, soil, seeds to sow, water, and the will to get your hands dirty and start. We bought many different seeds that we'll start today. Within days, the natural miracle will happen, and they will start germinating. Tomatoes, Peppers, Zucchini, Beans, you can start everything from seeds.

Early March and April are the perfect time to do it, but you should keep the seed propagators indoors if it is cold and take them out when sunny. We plan to expand our veggie garden this year, so we'll show you how we start the seeds, the germination, and the growing.
